# Neopixel Andon

A small  RGB indicator, like those seen on industrial CNC machines.

Bring a little bit of over the top automation to your 3D printer!  

Based on the Printer Events LED's from Marlin, but with a few changes.

## Features

### 360 degree Horizontal + 90 degree Upward Coverage

Equal light is spread around with wraparound LEDs, and to the top with an option upward facing pixel

### Software Disable

I keep my printer in my bedroom, so I need to turn the lights off for overnight printing.   That wasn't possible with Marlin, but some simple macros let it turn on and off with a single button push, and remember its current light setting.

### Temperature Tracking

Visually see how far close your printer is to printing temperatures.

- Configurable for hotend or chamber temp watching
