# V0 Small Back Panel

A little tiny 3D printable back panel to enclose the printing area of the V0 while leaving the electronics bay fully accessible.

I came up with this while doing a bunch of electronics modifications, but also needing to use my printer.  Rather than needing to continuously remove and re-insert the full length back panel, this is a small panel that sits just at the top, enclosing the mid-panel up to the tophat, but leaves the electronics fully open.

It also helps a lot with electronics temperatures, was getting around 70C on the Pi without cooling with the full back panel, maxing out around 47-50C now.
